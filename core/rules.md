# Fantasy Adventure Core Rules

## Introduction

*Fantasy Adventure* is a solitaire, or solo, Role-Playing system. It is best described as a cross between a choose your own adventure book, a video-game rogue-like, and a tabletop role playing game.

## Combat

Combat in *Fantasy Adventure* is skill-based. It is quick, gritty, and often deadly.

### Wounds

Unlike a lot of RPGs, getting hit in *Fantasy Adventure* is really devastating. Whenever a character is hit they take a wound. Most characters can only take a wound or two before it becomes fatal. There are two types of wounds, **Flesh Wounds** and **Grievous Wounds**.

#### Flesh Wound

A **Flesh Wound** is a type of wound you can recover from with some rest. These represent the cuts, bruises, and broken bones you may get while adventuring. 

#### Grievous Wound

**Grievous Wounds** represent the fatal or near-fatal wounds your character can take. If this was your last **Grievous Wound** your character has died. If it was not your last wound, you will have to roll for a *permanent* injury that persists even after you heal your wounds. This could be anything from a permanent limp to losing an eye or an arm.

## Defense

There are three main types of defenses in the game: **Dodge**, **Guard**, and **Protection**. If you have the ability to **Dodge** or **Guard**, you cannot take **Wounds**. **Protection** offered by armor offers a small chance to resist the damage.

### Dodge

**Dodge** is your character's ability to get out of the way and avoid attacks. Every character starts with innate **Dodge** ability unless it says otherwise. Enemies can try to **Pin** or **Root** you in place. While an enemy has you in either of these states, you may use the **Unpin** action to restore your **Dodge**.

#### Unpin

For your turn, you try to unpin yourself. **Pin** is automatically removed. **Root** has to roll for success. If you have both **Pin** and **Root** you have to take an action to cure each before you can **Dodge** again.


##### Rolling for **Root**

Roll 1 die. On a 3 or lower, you remain *Rooted*, while on a 4 or higher you are no longer **Rooted**.

### Guard

**Guard** is your character's ability to deflect attacks. Usually, your character requires something to guard with, usually a shield, in order to have **Guard**. Enemies can attempt to break through your **Guard**. If you have **Broken Guard** or **Destroyed Guard** you may use your action to **Recover Guard**.

#### Recover Guard

You may use an action to automatically remove **Guard Break**. You may use an action to attempt to remove **Destroyed Guard**. Removing **Destroyed Guard** automatically removes **Broken Guard**.

##### Rolling for **Destroyed Guard**

Roll 1 die. On a 3 or lower, your **Destroyed Guard** remains, while on a 4 or higher you no longer have **Destroyed Guard**.

### Protection

When an enemy attacks and you do not have the ability to **Dodge** or **Guard**, your last line of defense is your **Protection**. First you roll to see what body part the enemy attacks. Then, if you have protection on that body part that matches the damage type, you perform a protection roll to see if it helps. 

#### Body Part Roll

* 1: Left Leg
* 2: Right Leg
* 3: Left Arm
* 4: Right Arm
* 5: Torso
* 6: Head

#### Protection

Roll 1 die. Add 1 to the roll for each point of protection you have.

* 1-6: You take damage
* 7+: You resist the damage

## Death

Your character will probably die at some point. And that's ok! The game was designed to be this way. The world of *Fantasy Adventure* lives on, and you get to start fresh and try new choices. 

### Legend lives on

Your new character will have a chance to get some of dead characters stuff back. In most adventures there are loot rolls that have an option to retrieve a previous character's stuff. You can take one of their items and gain 1 XP for investigating how they died.

### Tips

Were you really attached to your character? Their story does not have to end. Maybe their sibling wants to take up adventuring to avenge them. Maybe someone they helped along the way was so inspired by your character's heroism that they decided to devote their life to adventuring. What if their biggest rival was sad they never got to make up with your character and choses to continue your character's quest for them?
